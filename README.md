## 📧 Email Configuration

The contact form requires email service configuration to send messages. You have two options:

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended - Free tier available)

1. Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com) and get your API key
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   CONTACT_EMAIL=alvoloconsulting@gmail.com
   ```

### Option 2: Gmail with Nodemailer

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   GMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here
   CONTACT_EMAIL=alvoloconsulting@gmail.com
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Choose one of the email options above
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
# OR
GMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here

# Where contact form submissions will be sent
CONTACT_EMAIL=alvoloconsulting@gmail.com
```

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is automatically ignored by Git for security reasons.

## Deployment

The site runs on Cloudflare Pages (project `alvoloconsulting`, custom domain alvoloconsulting.com) as a **direct upload**, not a Git integration.

```bash
npm run build          # sanity check (Next.js)
npm run pages:build    # @cloudflare/next-on-pages → .vercel/output/static  (run on Linux/WSL; the Vercel CLI it spawns is unreliable on Windows)
npm run pages:deploy   # wrangler pages deploy … --project-name alvoloconsulting
```

Add `--branch main` to `pages:deploy` to publish to production. `RESEND_API_KEY` and `CONTACT_EMAIL` must be set in the Pages project environment for the consultation intake (`/api/contact`) to send email.
